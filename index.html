    <p>Greetings, I'm Jack Skivar. This text is worthy of Mr. McGee's eyes. Uhhhhhh I'm really awesome and cool. I like Crusader Kings III and writing dumb stuff like history and storylines that are suspiciously similar
    to that of media I consume, like One Piece or One Punch Man.</p>

    <p>This is the first ever webpage I've ever made, for real. I mean it this time. Probably.</p>

    <p>Over the course of probably 3 years (if Mr. McGee doesn't LEAVE US!!!) this webpage will become the very first imprint I have ever made in my journey into becoming the greatest programmer ever.</p>

    <p>If you want to see my works, too bad. I don't know how to code that yet.</p>

    <p>Mandatory Joke: Why did the rat cross the road? To get to the KFC deep fryer on the other side ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹</p>

    <p style="font-size: 25px;">Stay awesome,<br>Jack Skivar</p>
