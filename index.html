  <h3>Greetings, I'm Jack Skivar. This text is worthy of Shawn McGee's eyes. Uhhhhhh I'm really awesome and cool. I like Crusader Kings III and writing dumb stuff like history and storylines that are suspiciously similar
  to that of media I consume, like One Piece or One Punch Man.</h3>
  
  <h3>This is the first ever webpage I've ever made, for real. I mean it this time. Probably.</h3>
  
  <h3>Over the course of probably 3 years (if Mr. McGee doesn't LEAVE US!!!) this webpage will become the very first imprint I have ever made in my journey into becoming the greatest programmer ever.</h3>
  
  <h3>If you want to see my works, too bad. I don't know how to code that yet.</h3>
  
  <p style="font-size: 100px;">Stay awesome,
  Jack Skivar</p>
